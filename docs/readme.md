# NPR CDS Plugin Docs

The NPR CDS Plugin provides push and pull functionality with the [NPR Content Distribution Service](https://npr.github.io/content-distribution-service/) along with a user-friendly administrative interface.

NPR's CDS is a content API, which essentially provides a structured way for other computer applications to pull NPR stories in a predictable, flexible and powerful way. The content that is available includes audio from most NPR programs dating back to 1995 as well as text, images and other web-only content from NPR and NPR member stations. This archive consists of over 250,000 stories that are grouped into more than 5,000 different aggregations.

Access to the NPR CDS requires an bearer token which you can get by [registering for an NPR account](https://studio.npr.org).

The WordPress plugin was originally developed as an Open Source plugin by NPR and is now supported by developers with NPR member stations working within the Open Public Media group. If you would like to suggest features or bug fixes, or better yet if you would like to contribute new features or bug fixes please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenPublicMedia/npr-cds-wordpress) and post an issue or contribute a pull request.
